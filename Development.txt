only for the use of developer

*extension are optional features depends on time

current state:
    keyboard response & mouse response is fine
    only one unknown exception happens
    ok type GUI
    massive bug with the currently playing label
    (hidden the bug with a black background)

final planning
    adding a nice GUI
    key press & key release effect
        buttons are made transparent
        functions are written in the comments
        just need to make images of the buttons
    [done for the white buttons, just vanishing the button
    1 problem still: a black button appears without proper sizing]

    debug problems [1 found: still unknown reason [Ghost Reason]]
    
    add a menu
    create a new bug free menu (bug free for god's sake) 
        menu will be added above the area of the keyboard
        best is to make a tabbed menu
        Menu[tabs]
            currently playing key[default tab]
                show the note playing
            Manual
                opens in new independent window
